= HW6
How to use:

GET /hw6/customer?caching={param} - lists all customers in database, param sets what caching method to use (lastmodified, etag, wetag)

Normally we would just send headers and let browser decide or only choose one option but for this homework, it is easier to test with parameter

POST /hw6/customers/{customerId} - Modifies customers name randomly (helper)

POST /hw6/customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId} - Modifies customers order randomly (helper for weak etag)
